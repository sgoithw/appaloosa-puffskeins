      <p class="news-description">Daily norm of sports</p>
      <p class="news-text">The World Health Organization recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week for adults aged 18-64. However, what happens if we adjust that number to 110 minutes every day? While it might seem like a high number to hit, dedicating 110 minutes daily to sporting activities may offer unparalleled benefits to physical health, mental well-being, and overall quality of life.</p>
