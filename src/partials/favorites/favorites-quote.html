                            don't
                            ever
                            develop that attitude, and the ones who aren't blessed in that way are the most competitive
                            and
                            have

                    <p class="news-text">The World Health Organization recommends at least 150 minutes of
                        moderate-intensity
                        aerobic physical activity throughout the week for adults aged 18-64. However, what happens if we
                        adjust that number to 110 minutes every day? While it might seem like a high number to hit,
                        dedicating 110 minutes daily to sporting activities may offer unparalleled benefits to physical
                        health, mental well-being, and overall quality of life.</p>
